# Baha Drills & Parts for Extraplanetary Launchpads :: Change Log

* 2014-0221: 1.2 (BahamutoD) for KSP 0.23.5 (Date estimated)
	+ Added expandable containers
	+ Added Launchpad
	+ Added 3D rocket parts printer
	+ Notes:
		- Includes an early version of my Animation Modules plugin that allows the container and 3d printer animations.
		- I'm not entirely satisfied with the 3D printer yet but I thought I'd let people play with it for now.
		- Plugin Source (bdanimSource0.1.zip) is M.I.A.
